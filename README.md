# 2024 NASA Hackathon - Space Apps Seattle

## Challenge: Seismic Detection Across the Solar System
### Team: Quake or not to Quake
#### Members: [Ian Alderson](https://github.com/CodingWithIanAlderson), [Anthony Ambs](https://github.com/AnthonyAmbs), [Alex Ayala](https://github.com/alexayalamcs), [Brett Baker](https://github.com/nbgardener), [Alexandre Beauchamp](https://github.com/princemallow), [Rayne Davidson](https://github.com/raynedavidson)

This is the GitHub Repository for the Quake or Not to Quake team participating in the 2024 NASA Hackathon.

We utilized Short-Term and Long-Term Averages and Machine Learning to identify the arrival times of quakes on other planets and reduce the load of data that needs to be transmitted back to Earth.

This is the GitHub Repository for the Quake or Not to Quake team participating in the 2024 NASA Hackathon.

We utilized Short-Term and Long-Term Averages and Machine Learning to identify the arrival times of quakes on other planets and reduce the load of data that needs to be transmitted back to Earth.
